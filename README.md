Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major public health concern with rising
prevalence. Kidney disease is when the kidneys are damaged and could not filter the
blood properly. This damage could cause the wastes to build up in the body. There
are five stages of CKD, the most serious one is stage 5 because, at this stage, the
kidneys are unable to do most of their functions. It is difficult to pinpoint the CKD
stage of each patient especially at the early stages. It also causes a high possibility of
death within a short period of time, a patient must be hospitalized and appropriately
cured. The most common causes of kidney disease are diabetes and high blood
pressure. Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives the ability of
machines to learn without being explicitly programmed. By using computational
methods, machine learning has shown success in providing solutions for early stage
diagnosis in a variety of medical domains. These methods are used to find hidden
patterns from data and mine these data for decision makers.
Chronic kidney disease(CKD) also known as chronic renal failure,It is associated with
a gradual loss of renal function.The kidneys filter waste products and
excess water from the blood and excrete it in the urine.Advanced chronic kidney
disease can accumulate dangerous levels of water,electrolytes and waste products
in the body.In the early stages of CKD, there may be few signs or symptoms.You
may not be aware of kidney disease until it has progressed.Treatment of chronic
kidney disease usually focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage by
controlling the cause.But even managing the cause cannot stop the progression of
kidney damage.
Chronic kidney disease can progress to endstage renal disease, which is fatal
without artificial filtration (dialysis) or kidney transplantation, Kidney disorder 
additionally will increase your chance of getting coronary heart and blood vessel disor1
der.These issues can also additionally manifest slowly over an extended time.Early
detection and remedy can regularly maintain persistent kidney disorder from getting
worse. When kidney disorder progresses,it is able to finally result in kidney failure,
which calls for dialysis or a kidney transplant to keep life.so As earlier as discussed
to need a better prediction system to avoid risk of dying as well as controlling the
morbidity rate.
